TheMadoff1000.com which is a ranking of all the best scammers, grifters, and con artists. Stole the idea from Shaan Puri's LinkedIn post here: https://www.linkedin.com/posts/shaanpuri_instead-of-the-forbes-30-under-30-we-need-activity-7025885354536632320-eME2?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop

Think about the Forbes list but for people who have scammed people out of their money. The list would be ranked by the amount of money they have scammed.

Ironically many of these people first appeared on the Forbes 30 under 30 list or similar list.
